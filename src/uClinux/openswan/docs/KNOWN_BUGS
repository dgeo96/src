1)	we are pretty certain that we have not consistently broken SMP
	support in KLIPS. It compiled, but it almost certainly locks up. This
	is probably an improvement, since before, it only sometimes locked up,
	and we didn't really know why. This includes running in P4's with
	hyperthreading activated.

	We do not have an ETA on a fix, although it is important to us.

2)	We are aware of problems where more than 10 initiations/second may
	cause the system to fail to negotiate ANY SAs. We are not certain
	of the cause, but it is not made better by setting nhelpers=0.
	Note that our previous record for SA setups/second was 11/second, so
	it may well be availability of entropy.

3)	Multiple L2TP clients behind the same NAT router, and multiple L2TP
	clients behind different NAT routers using the same Virtual IP is
	currently broken. This will not be fixed in the 2.4 series.

	We do not have an ETA on a fix, though work has started on it. If
	you need this fix, or wishes to contribute resources to Xelerance,
	please contact us.
