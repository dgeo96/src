.\" 	while tracking down a missing (not installed) /etc/ipsec.conf,
.\" 	MCR has decided that it is not okay for each program subdir to have
.\" 	some subset (determined with -f) of possible files.
.\" 	Each subdir that defines $PROGRAM, MUST have a PROGRAM.8 file as well as a PROGRAM file.
.\" 	Optional PROGRAM.5 files have been added to the makefiles.
